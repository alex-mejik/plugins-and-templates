		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) About The Template</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Included in this template package are 2 HTML pages - The main landing page is perfectly formatted using good practices for landing page design including strong, obvious CTA areas (Call To Action) to help convert visitors into clients / customers. The design is based on the popular &quot;Z&quot; pattern to guide the eye around from title to content to video and purchase. We have many special areas including the video area above the fold, along with a strong defined benefit area on the left, with the ever popular &quot;Free Bonus&quot; directly under the video to help convert - we also have quote areas to strengthen confidence in your product and then we also have the ability to show small images, that once clicked provide an immediate floating lightbox gallery of images, with thumbs and auto rotation - the perfect lightbox!</p>
		<p>The second page is simply an inner page design showing a selection of pre-formatted text styles and elements that you can use for example as a continuation page - the choice is yours.</p>
        
      <p>Landing pages are very specific beasts - they demand a clear and precise message, easy to read content, clear benefits and simple imagery to portray the product - finally, but yet most importantly a call to action area should be above the fold and stand out with another benefit in text on the button. There are a wealth of articles online that explain many things above landing pages - technically ANY page is a landing page on any website, but the industry has many names for conversion focused designs and the most popular is "landing page". Good practices have been included in this design with a lose &quot;Z&quot; reading pattern, clear messages, good sharp design and benefits everywhere - try to keep your message clear and to the point - remember that the first 2 words in a paragraph are the most likey to be read or skimmed over - so start with something strong!</p>
        
        <p>Using the pre-defined areas on the page to highlight your products benefits will work for you - don't create 25 list items under benefits - most that will be read is about 4 or 5 - adding too much fancy stuff will block the message also - use the lightbox galleryarea to your advantage. Landing page design and implementation is almost an artform - but one without 100% proven ways of doing things - they require time and testing - changing colors etc changing one thing can make a huge difference - be patient - you have a wonderful starting block with these templates so use it as such.</p>
        
        <p>You will also notice that the social aspect of the web that is very important to be able to reach out to your customers and gain feedback and to spread the word about your product are included - they are in the footer of the page as people are used to them being there, but without distracting from the content - handy fancy tooltips add a more polished appearance to the icons and help strengthen rollover on buy now buttons etc. </p>
      
      <p>The HTML is correctly coded and passed inspection at W3C Markup Validation Service - calls all javascript files and css files in each file where necessary. You should not have to change anything in the way these html files connect to their relevant css and js files as long as you upload everything in order.. <br>
<br>

All div's have been labeled to make alterations as easy as possible within the html and CSS files.</p>
		
<img src="assets/images/htmlstructure.png" alt="HTML Structure" width="842" height="460" />
		
		<p>If you would like to edit the color, font, or style of any elements, you would edit the corresponding CSS style in the CSS file in the CSS folder:</p>

<pre>	p {
	font-family:QlassikBoldRegular;
	font-size:16px;
	color: #525252;
	line-height: 18px;
	font-weight: normal;
	} 
</pre>

		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>I'm using 3 CSS files in this template. Included in this template download is a single CSS directory / folder for the template - all necessary css files are included and shouldn't need any alterations unless you wish to customize anything. Here is a list and description for each one:</p> 
        
        
        		<ol>
				<li>main.css - used to style the template page for all browsers</li>
				<li>prettyPhoto.css - used to style the lightbox </li>
				<li>inner.css - used to style the extra page only for all browsers</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>NOTE: included in the css folder are the web friendly @fontface fonts used for various browsers - all the same  font qlassik - these are required for the use of the special font in browsers for all pages.</p>
      <p>Each css file should be easy to follow and if using a modern html page editor you should be able to easily see the structure of each css file.</p>
      <p><img src="assets/images/cssstructure.png" alt="CSS Structure" width="842" height="460" /></p>
<hr>
		
		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Included in this template download is a single JS directory / folder - all necessary JS files are included (3 in total) and shouldn't need any alterations unless you wish to customize anything. Here is a list and description for each one:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jquery-1.3.2.min.js - the main JQuery library.</li>
			<li>tipsy.js - powers the social icon tool tips - http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/</li>
			<li>jquery.prettyPhoto.js - used for the lightbox gallery</li>
		</ol>
        
<p>Please note that alterations to JS files could result in certain features not working - you should not attempt to alter javascript unless you are experienced - please use the web site references next to each JS file listed above for further details and help.</p>

		<h3 id="psdFiles"><strong>D) PSD Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I've included 2 psd's (photoshop native files) with this theme:</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Qloud.psd - fully layered photoshop file of the main page design</li>
      </ol>
		
	  <p>The  PSD file can be opened in Photoshop CS3 or earlier and contain well labelled layers and groups.<br>All layers are grouped so that elements from sections are contained in a group labelled for ease of finding something very quickly.<br>All layer effects (styles) are included on the layers so that full editing and personalization is fully available.<br>
</p>

		<h3 id="credits"><strong>E) Sources, Credits and Fonts - </strong><a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I've used the following graphical items / fonts that are free to use by their kind authors.
  <ul>
			<li>Qlassik Font - <a href="http://www.dafont.com/qlassik.font" title="Qlassik Font Free Download" target="_blank">http://www.dafont.com/qlassik.font</a></li>
			<li>Retina icons - The Working Group - <a href="http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset%3ATWG_Retina_Icons" title="Retina Icons" target="_blank">http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset%3ATWG_Retina_Icons</a></li>
  </ul>

		<h3 id="php"><strong>F) PHP Mailer File</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Included in this template is a fully working email subscription form - you may want to replace my code with that supplied by a service such as mailchimp or campaignmonitor so emails are dropped automatically in to a database of those services - however if you simply want the persons email sent to your email address you have everything needed - the PHP file requires mail () function to be properly setup on php5 server - if it doesn't work you will need to contact your host to ask for their assistance - but 99.99% of people can use it right out of the box - APART from one thing - you MUST add your email address to the file - open in a text editor (plain text like notepad or text edit) or indeed any regular software used for coding such as Dreamweaver and look for the address area at the top - the one you receive says &quot;you@you.com&quot; - change this to your email address and upload to the same location as your HTML files. </p>
		<p>The PHP mailer will also check that the email supplied is a properly formatted email before it can be submitted - once submitted it will show a dynamic thank you message - you can change this message if you want in the html file before the body tag - I have a large commented area letting you know where the JS is and you should be able to quite easily change the message to your requirements right there.</p>
